* Translating English to Logic

** Example 1

1. If my nose is cold, then I am unhappy.
2. If I'm happy, then my nose is not cold.
3. My nose is not cold or I'm unhappy.

Let p: my nose is cold.
Let q: I am unhappy

Therefore,
1. \( p \implies q \)
2. \( \lnot q \implies \lnot p \)
3. \( \lnot p \lor q \)

All of these statements are logically equivalent!

** Example 2

> You can major in CSE only if you pass EECS 203.

Let p: you can major in CSE.
Let q: you pass EECS 203

Therefore, \( p \implies q \). We can also represent this as
\( \lnot q \implies \lnot p \), and a literal translation of
that would be:

> If you don't pass EECS 203, you can't major in CSE.

* Definitions

- A *tautology* is a compound proposition that is always true.
- A *contradiction* is a compound proposition that is always false.
- $p$ and $q$ are *logically equivalent* if $p \iff q$ is a tautology.

* Useful Logical Equivalences

- $p \land T = p$
- $p \lor T = T$
- $p \land F = F$
- $p \lor F = p$
- $\lnot (\lnot p) = p$
- $p \lor p = p$
- $p \land p = p$

Commutative Laws:
- $p \lor q = q \lor p$
- $p \land q = q \land p$

Associative Laws:
- $(p \lor q) \lor r = p \lor (q \lor r)$
- $(p \land q) \land r = p \land (q \land r)$

Distributive Laws:
- $p \lor (q \land r) = (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)$
- $p \land (q \lor r) = (p \land q) \lor (p \land r)$

DeMorgan's Laws:
- $\lnot (p \land q) = \lnot p \lor \lnot p$
- $\lnot (p \lor q) = \lnot q \land \lnot q$

* Biconditional

$$ p \iff q \equiv (p \implies q) \land (q \implies p) $$

* Proof techniques

\begin{align*}
\lnot (p \lor (\lnot p \land q)) &\equiv \lnot p \land \lnot q \\
&\equiv \lnot ((p \lor \lnot p) \land (p \lor q)) \\
&\equiv \lnot (T \land (p \lor q)) \\
&\equiv \lnot (p \lor q) \\
&\equiv \lnot p \land \lnot q
\end{align*}

* Logical Circuits

It is a good idea to use logical equivalences to simplify circuits.

* Logic Puzzles

** Example 1

Two people, Alice and Bob, are either liars or truth-tellers.

Statements:
Alice: "Bob is a truthteller."
Bob: "Alice and I are different types."

- Let $p$ :: Alice is a truthteller
- Let $q$ :: Bob is a truthteller
             
| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lxor q$ | $(p \iff q) \land (q \iff (p \lxor q))$ |
|-----+-----+-------------+-----------------------------------------|
| T   | T   | F           | T \land F \equiv F                      |
| T   | F   | T           | F \land F \equiv F                      |
| F   | T   | T           | F \land T \equiv F                      |
| F   | F   | F           | T \land T \equiv T                      |
