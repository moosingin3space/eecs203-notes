* Introduction

A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of a non-empty set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$
of edges. Each edge is associated with two verticies.

* Types of Graph

- Directed graph :: All edges have directions
- Undirected graph :: no arrows
- Mixed graph :: definition obviously follows
                 
* Graph Organizations

- Complete graph :: all nodes are connected
- Cycle :: there is a path that leads from one node back to itself.
- Wheels :: A hub-and-spoke organization scheme
- Hypercube :: If each node is assigned a bitstring, only one bit changes at once.
- Bipartite graph :: it is possible to partition the set of vertices $V$ into 
     two disjoint sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ where every edge connects from one
     partition to the other.
- Perfect matching :: A set of edges that touches every vertex exactly once.
     A perfect matching can only be found if there is no constricted set.
- Constricted set :: Given a vertex $A$, $|N(A)| < |A|$
                 
* Terminology
  
** Undirected Graph

- $u$ and $v$ are adjacent vertices or neighbors if connected by an edge
- The set of all neighbors is called a neighborhood
- The degree of a vertex is the number of vertices incident on it (count
  self-loops twice)

** Directed Graph

Two types of degree: in-degree for incoming edges and out-degree for outgoing
edges.

** Subgraphs and Unions

The union of two graphs is given by
$$ G_1 \union G_2 = (V_1 \union V_2, E_1 \union E_2) $$

/Subgraphs/ meet the following conditions:
\begin{align*}
G &= (V, E) \\
H &= (W, F) \\
W &\subseteq V \\
F &\subseteq E
\end{align*}

If $G \ne H$, then $H$ is a /proper subgraph/ of $G$.

* Handshake Theorem

For a graph $G = (V, E)$,
$$ 2 |E| = \sum_{v \in V} \mathrm{deg}(v) $$

** Implications

An undirected graph has an even number of nodes of odd degree.
* Hall's Marriage Theorem

A bipartite graph has a /complete matching/ from $V_1$ to $V_2$ iff 
$|N(A)| \ge |A|$.
